# Cinema booking system project
A simple yet effective ticket booking system which can be used in small to medium cinemas in order to facilitate their business needs.

## About
This project is realized as a part of my databases course in HSE, Moscow.

## Getting started
I have tried to containerize this application in order for everyone to be able to easily test it and modify it to their needs.

### Instructions
Prerequisites: In order to test this project, you need to have [docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed on your system. This project uses the docker compose mechanism, so if you are running it from the command line, you just need to type `docker-compose up` in the current working directory. This will call the generated [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) file, which is responsible for firing up the Postgres database instance and eventually the react UI.

## Technical details
The main focus of this project is going to be its database design, but if I have enough time, I will also try to incorporate a user interface as well.

## Database structure
You can find the notes about the database organization and structure [here](db/README.md).

## User interface
It is my intention to create a user interface for this database project in order to make it more perceivable for everyone. I want to implement it using one of the famous UI frontend frameworks - React.js or Vue.js.

Is turns out that there are a lot of things that I need to learn before creating a web-based UI for my project as I wanted, so this will remain as an open task.
